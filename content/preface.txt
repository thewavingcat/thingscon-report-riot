# Preface

**The ThingsCon report [The State of Responsible IoT](http://bit.ly/riot-report) is a collection of essays by experts from the inter-disciplinary [ThingsCon](http://thingscon.com) community of IoT practitioners. It explores the challenges, opportunities and questions surrounding the creation of a responsible & human-centric Internet of Things (IoT). For your convenience you can read it [on Medium](https://medium.com/the-state-of-responsible-internet-of-things-iot) or [download a PDF](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ktyglbx3h2do6wk/The%20State%20of%20Resonsible%20IoT%20-%20A%20ThingsCon%20Report.pdf?dl=0).**

**It's a critical time in the development of the Internet of Things (IoT). We believe the ThingsCon community has a valuable contribution to make to ensure a future where IoT works for everyone: A responsible & human-centric IoT.**

As part of our advocacy this key issue we gathered contributors from across the ThingsCon community and put together a report on the state of responsible IoT.

This report is a collection of essays and articles by experts from a wide range of disciplines covering a wide range of topics, issues and questions around responsible & human-centric IoT.

We find it important to cover a wide range of issues and perspectives—disciplinary, regional, cultural—and so asked authors to take a high degree of freedom. The collection encompasses very different voices: Essays range from bird’s eye perspective to hands-on advice; some stem from an academic context, others are grounded in practice.

We see this is a first step on a longer journey—a kickoff if you will. We will keep adding to this collection: As the questions surrounding responsible IoT change, so will this project. We will continue to do this as much in the open as possible (see the section "Keep it open!" below).
